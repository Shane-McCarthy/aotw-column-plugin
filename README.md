Theme Short Code Customization 
===================================
this plugin was developed to speed up development of the modernize theme (goodlayers)
- Shortcode takes a paramenter of page id and outputs custom column HTML, this code allows you to pick the pages that you
  would like to display in the columns that are provided in the theme. this adds to theme functionality which currently
  only allows pages to be displayed that are children of displaying page.
